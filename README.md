Introduction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and take necessary actions to prevent them from leaving.

In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on customer data. We use a combination of logistic regression and random forest classifiers to make predictions, and we evaluate the models using classification reports and ROC curves.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
images/: Contains images generated during EDA and model evaluation.
models/: Stores trained machine learning models.
src/: This directory contains the source code files, including the main Python script.
README.md: The main documentation file you are currently reading.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd customer-churn-prediction
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see Dependencies).

Follow the usage instructions to run the code.

Usage
To run the code and predict customer churn, you can execute the main script as follows:

shell
Copy code
python main.py
Save to grepper
This script performs data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The results will be stored in the images/ and models/ directories.

Data
The dataset used for this project is stored in the data/ directory. The dataset should include information about customers and whether they churned or not. It's important to ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and labeled for the code to work correctly.

Features
The features used for predicting customer churn include:

Customer Age
Dependent Count
Months on Book
Total Relationship Count
Months Inactive (12 months)
Contacts Count (12 months)
Credit Limit
Total Revolving Balance
Average Open-to-Buy
Total Amount Change (Q4 to Q1)
Total Transaction Amount
Total Transaction Count
Total Count Change (Q4 to Q1)
Average Utilization Ratio
Gender
Education Level
Marital Status
Income Category
Card Category
These features are used to build predictive models.

Data Preprocessing
The code includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Data preprocessing is essential to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to gain insights into the data. The code generates visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships. EDA results are saved in the images/ directory.

Feature Engineering
The code includes feature engineering to create new features based on categorical variables. These features are used to improve the model's performance.

Model Training
Two machine learning models are trained: logistic regression and random forest. Grid search is used to optimize hyperparameters. The trained models are saved in the models/ directory.

Model Evaluation
The code evaluates the models using classification reports and ROC curves. Model evaluation results are saved as images in the images/ directory.

Results
The project's results include trained models, model evaluation metrics, and EDA visualizations. These results can be used to make predictions about customer churn and inform business decisions.
