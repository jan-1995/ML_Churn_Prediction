## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and take necessary actions to prevent them from leaving.

In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on customer data. We use a combination of logistic regression and random forest classifiers to make predictions, and we evaluate the models using classification reports and ROC curves.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `images/`: Contains images generated during EDA and model evaluation.
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files, including the main Python script.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file you are currently reading.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
