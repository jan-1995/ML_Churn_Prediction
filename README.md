## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and take necessary actions to prevent them from leaving.

In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on customer data. We use a combination of logistic regression and random forest classifiers to make predictions, and we evaluate the models using classification reports and ROC curves.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `images/`: Contains images generated during EDA and model evaluation.
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files, including the main Python script.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file you are currently reading.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/jan-1995/customer-churn-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   
    ```shell
   cd customer-churn-prediction

## Usage

To run the code and predict customer churn, you can execute the main script as follows:

 ```shell
python main.py


## Data

The dataset should include information about customers and whether they churned or not.
It's important to ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and labeled for the code to work correctly.
